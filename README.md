# LeafCode
LeafCode: A shared code Repo

1) Code collaboration for different languages, Data Structure, Algorithms and Questions asked in different interview, company wise.
2) Challange board will be created, on which anyone can update their problem and others will commit their solutions
3) Automated testsuite/scripts to test the piece of code committed
4) Full Makefile approach so that one can just pull and compile asap, and start using and contributing.
5) New Ideas are Welcome.
